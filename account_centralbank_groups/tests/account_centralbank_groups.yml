  In order to test account transaction I create a new transaction
-
  !context
    uid: 'base_community.user_luc'
-
  !record {model: account.centralbank.transaction, id: transaction_test_0}:
    sender_id: base.res_partner_12
    receiver_id: base.main_partner
    description: 'Test transaction between groups'
    currency_ids:
      - model: "account.centralbank.transaction"
        res_id: transaction_test_0
        field: "currency_ids"
        price_unit: 50
        currency_id: account_centralbank.COM
-
  I check that roger, which isn't a moderator and isn't even implicated in the transaction can't confirm it
-
  !context
    uid: 'base_community.user_roger'
-
  !python {model: account.centralbank.transaction}: |
    from openerp.osv import osv
    try:
      self.confirm(cr, uid, [ref('transaction_test_0')])
      assert False, "Roger was able to confirm the transaction!"
    except osv.except_osv:
      pass
-
  I check that mark, which isn't a moderator and has wallet right on the receiver group can't confirm it
-
  !context
    uid: 'base_community.user_mark'
-
  !python {model: account.centralbank.transaction}: |
    from openerp.osv import osv
    try:
      self.confirm(cr, uid, [ref('transaction_test_0')])
      assert False, "Mark was able to confirm the transaction!"
    except osv.except_osv:
      pass
-
  I check that luc, wich isn't a moderator and has wallet right on the sender group can confirm it
-
  !context
    uid: 'base_community.user_luc'
-
  !python {model: account.centralbank.transaction}: |
    self.confirm(cr, uid, [ref('transaction_test_0')])
-
  !assert {model: account.centralbank.transaction, id: transaction_test_0, string: "Luc wasn't able to confirm the transaction, or the confirm state wasn't skipped!"}:
    - state == 'done'
