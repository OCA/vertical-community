  In order to test account transaction I create a new currency and transaction
-
  !record {model: res.currency, id: DUMMY}:
    name: DUMMY
    symbol: DUMMY
    rounding: 0.01
    accuracy: 4

    currency_id: DUMMY
    rate: 1.0
-
  !record {model: account.wallet.config.currency, id: wallet_currency_DUMMY}:
    config_id: base_community.community_settings
    currency_id: DUMMY
    limit_negative: 0
    limit_positive: 0
    partner_availability_account_id: community_partner_availability_account
    partner_reserved_account_id: community_partner_reserved_account
    partner_expense_account_id: community_partner_expense_account
    partner_income_account_id: community_partner_income_account
    external_currency: 1
-
  !assert {model: account.wallet.config.currency, id: wallet_currency_DUMMY, string: "The external_currency isn't correctly configured!"}:
    - external_currency == True
