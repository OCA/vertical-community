  In order to test marketplace.proposition I create a new proposition with the moderator nhomar
-
  !context
    uid: 'base_community.user_nhomar'
-
  !record {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3}:
    announcement_id: announcement_test_1
    description: We think we can help you
    sender_id: partner_test2
    quantity: 1
    currency_ids:
      - model: "account.wallet.transaction"
        field: "currency_ids"
        price_unit: 100
        currency_id: account_wallet.COM
-
  I check that nhomar can publish it
-
  !python {model: marketplace.proposition}: |
    from openerp import workflow
    workflow.trg_validate(uid, 'marketplace.proposition', ref('proposition_test_3'), 'proposition_draft_open', cr)
-
  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "Test2 wasn't able to publish the proposition!"}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  I check that nhomar can accept it
-
  !python {model: marketplace.proposition}: |
    from openerp import workflow
    workflow.trg_validate(uid, 'marketplace.proposition', ref('proposition_test_3'), 'proposition_open_accepted', cr)
-
  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "Test1 wasn't able to accept the proposition!"}:
    - state == 'accepted'
-
  I check that nhomar can invoice it
-
  !python {model: marketplace.proposition}: |
    from openerp import workflow
    workflow.trg_validate(uid, 'marketplace.proposition', ref('proposition_test_3'), 'proposition_accepted_invoiced', cr)
-
  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "Test1 wasn't able to invoice the proposition!"}:
    - state == 'invoiced'
-
  I check that a invoice transaction was made
-
  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "No invoice transaction was made"}:
    - invoice_id.id != False
-
  I check that nhomar can pay it
-
  !python {model: marketplace.proposition}: |
    self.pay(cr, uid, [ref('proposition_test_3')])
-
  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "Test2 wasn't able to pay the proposition or confirm state wasn't skipped!"}:
    - state == 'vote'
-
  I check that a payment transaction was made
-
  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "No payment transaction was made"}:
    - payment_id.id != False
-
  I write the votes from nhomar
-
  !record {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3}:
    vote_vote_ids:
      - model: "marketplace.proposition"
        partner_id: partner_test1

        line_ids:

-
  I check that votes are complete and the proposition went in the final stage
-
  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "The votes wasn't enough to move the proposition in his final stage!"}:
    - state == 'paid'

  !assert {model: marketplace.proposition, id: proposition_test_3, string: "Test2 wasn't able to cancel the proposition, or the confirm refund state was skipped!"}:
    - state == 'cancel'
